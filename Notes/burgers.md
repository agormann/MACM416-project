# "Burger's Equation"

## Info

* Main formulation is: u_t + u u_x = v u_xx; named 'viscous' Burger's Equation. If v=0, then called 'inviscid' Burger's equation.
* Nonlinear PDE; quasi-linear.
* No reason why we cannot add coefficients or source/sink terms - but the properties as well as the interpretation will change.
* Inviscid form is relatively simple and has an analytic solution via the 'Method of Characteristics.'
* Viscous form requires more effort (we apply the Cole-Hopf transform), but analytic solution still attained.
